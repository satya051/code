# File Compression Utility using Huffman Coding

A C++ based file compression and decompression tool that uses Huffman Coding for efficient, lossless data compression.

## Technologies Used:
- C++
- Data Structures
- File I/O

## How to Build and Run:
1. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o compress`).
2. Run the program (`./compress inputfile outputfile`).

## Example Usage:
```bash
./compress myfile.txt compressed_file.bin
./decompress compressed_file.bin decompressed_file.txt
